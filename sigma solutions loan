Based in Austin, Texas, Backd offers working capital loans and lines of credit for small business borrowers. As a business owner, you can apply for a Backd line of credit and get preapproval with a soft credit check. If approved, you can draw between $10,000 and $750,000 for your company’s short-term needs.

Why Backd is best for fast funding: With instant preapprovals and access to funding in as little as 24 hours, Backd’s lines of credit might appeal if you need cash quickly.

Who Backd's line of credit is good for: Consider a Backd line of credit if you’re running a relatively new business that could benefit from prompt access to funding. As a trade-off for this speed and convenience, though, you’ll need to be okay with at least an 18.00 percent simple interest rate and be able to make weekly repayments.
