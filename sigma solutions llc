California-based online lender National Funding may be a good choice for young businesses — so long as they’re making enough revenue. You may qualify for a loan as large as $5,000 after just six months of operating. It also offers equipment financing that companies can use to buy the tools they need to operate.

Why National Funding is best for early payoff discount: National Funding only requires six months in business and offers loans as low as $500 or up to $1,000. This flexibility allows businesses to borrow only the needed amount. Plus there are no prepayment penalties, and borrowers can receive an early payment discount if they're able to pay off their loan in full ahead of schedule.

Who National Funding's working capital loan is good for: If your business generates high cash flow and needs money to keep growing, this loan could be worth exploring.
